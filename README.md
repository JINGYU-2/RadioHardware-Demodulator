## Introduction
This project entails the collaborative effort of second-year ECE students, tasked with designing subsystems for a Software-Defined Radio (SDR) transceiver. My team focused on developing the demodulator and audio amplifier, serving as the final link in the receiver chain. This subsystem's core function involves converting processed radio signals into audio and subsequently amplifying it to drive large speakers.
